# Used-Cars-Price-Prediction
The project objective is to develop a differential pricing strategy based on a machine learning model capable of predicting used cars prices within the Indian used cars market. In this regard, several regression models have been developed from simple linear (Elastic Net, Bayesian ridge), to ensemble learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBOOST) and Artificial Neural Network. All their performances metrics have been evaluated without and with regularizaton (MSE,RMSE,MAE,MAPE,R2,adj_R2) and the best model hyperparameter tuned.

Based on the Exploratory Data Analysis, key business insights and recommendations have been derived from the dataset and contributed to tayloring the predictive model. The best model (XGBOOST) highlighted the key features involved in the differential pricing strategy such as the used cars transmission type,  year, fuel type and number of seat. Eventually, limitations of the model have been identified along with the recommendation of the next steps for its development and launch in production.
